// Routes: the loudspeaker through Qt, the earpiece (phone at the ear) through a GStreamer
// pipeline while the app holds the audio policy's call class, like the calls (ADR 0034) —
// Full-flavour only (EarpiecePlayer).
//
// Only the user starts the sound. Sailfish's resource policy pauses a QMediaPlayer when something
// else takes the audio and resumes it by itself when it comes back; here that stays a pause.
// Nothing lingers either: closing the window ends the playback (main.cpp), the chat drops a paused
// message when it is left, and a message left paused for long goes by itself.
