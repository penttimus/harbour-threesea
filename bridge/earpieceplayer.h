// voice-communication role the phone played scrambled silence (user report 2026-10-29), while
// the calls' pipeline is known to work on the same device.

// Full flavour only (Lite must not link GStreamer, and its sandbox has no Sensors permission,
// so nothing there puts the phone to the ear). The data stays in memory; the pipeline reads it
// through an appsrc, so the decrypted audio never reaches the disk.
